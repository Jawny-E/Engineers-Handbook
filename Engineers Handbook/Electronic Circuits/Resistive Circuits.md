## Ohm's Law
> [!CITE] Ohms's Law
> The voltage across a resistance is directly proportional to the current flowing through it. The resistance, measured in Ohms (Î©), is the constant of proportionality between the voltage and the current. 

Electrical components which are mostly resistive in nature are called [[Resistors|resistors]] and are usually wire-wound or made with metal films.
###### The mathematical relationship of Ohm's Law
$$
\begin{align}
v(t)=R\cdot i(t), where R \geqslant 0
\tag{2.1}
\end{align}
$$

By definition we also have that $1\Omega =1\frac{V}{A}$

It is important to note that we assume the resistors are linear. In real life applications these components will exhibit non-linear  behaviour. 

###### Instantaneous power for resistive circuit
As indicated earlier the rate of energy dissipation in a resistor is the instantaneous power, and therefore we can rewrite the function for power:
![[Basic Concepts#Voltage multiplied with current]]

$$
\begin{align}  \\
p(t)=v(t)\cdot i(t)
\tag{2.2} \\\\
v(t) = R\cdot i(t) \quad\mathrm{and}\quad i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}
 \\ \\
p(t)=R\cdot i^2(t)=\frac{v^2(t)}{R}
\tag{2.3}
\end{align}
$$
This equation illustrates that the power is a **non-linear** function of either current or voltage and that it is always a positive quantity (absorbs power).
###### Conductance
The inverse of the resistance is the *conductance* measured in Siemens. Therefore the following expressions apply:
$$
\begin{align} 
G=\frac{1}{R}
\tag{2.4} \\ \\
1S = 1\frac{A}{V} \\ \\
i(t)=G\cdot v(t)  
\tag{2.5} \\\\
p(t)=\frac{i^2(t)}{G}=G\cdot v^2(t)
\tag{2.6}
\end{align}
$$

## Kirchoff's Law

To further study electronic circuits we need to employ some terminlogy: nodes, loops, meshes and branches.

Given these definitions we can now discuss Kirchoff's circuit laws. Named after German scientist Gustav Robert Kirchoff(1824-1877). 
###### Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL)
> [!CITE] Kirchoffs Current Law(KCL)
> The algebraic sum of the currents entering any node is zero
> $$\sum_{j=1}^{N}i_j(t)=0\tag{2.7}$$
###### Kirchoff's Voltage law (KVL)
> [!CITE] Kirchoffs Voltage Law(KVL)
> The algebraic sum of voltages around any loop is zero. 
> $$\sum_{j=1}^{N}v_j(t)=0\tag{2.8}$$

## Single Loop Circuits
##### Problem Solving Strategy 
1. Define a current *i(t)*. We know using KCL that there is only one current for a single-loop circuit. This current is assumed to be flowing either clockwise or counterclockwise around the loop
2. Using [[Resistive Circuits#Ohm's Law|Ohm's law]], define a voltage across each resistor in terms of the defined current
3. Apply [[Resistive Circuits#Kirchoff's Voltage law (KVL)|KVL]] to the single-loop circuit
4. Solve the single KVL equation for the current *i(t)*. If *i(t)* is positive the current is flowing in the assumed direction
##### The Voltage Divider
![[Pasted image 20240602223012.png]]
To start of with we assume that the current goes in a clockwise direction. We have also assigned a voltage polarity for $v_{R_1}$ and  $v_{R_2}$. Applying [[Resistive Circuits#Kirchoff's Voltage law (KVL)|KVL]] to this circuit gives us the following:
$$
\begin{align}
-v(t)+v_{R_1}+v_{R_2} = 0\\
v_{R_1}+v_{R_2} =v(t) \\
\end{align}
$$
Further from Ohm's law we can find that 
$$
\begin{align}
v_{R_1} = R_1\cdot i(t)\\
v_{R_2} = R_2\cdot i(t) \\
\end{align}
$$
Combining the KVL and Ohms analysis we can find that:
$$
\begin{align}
v_{R_1}+v_{R_2} =v(t) \\ \\
R_1\cdot i(t)+R_2 \cdot i(t) = v(t) \\ \\
i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R_1+R_2}
\tag{2.9}
\end{align}
$$
If we know the current we can now find the Voltage across each resistor:
$$
\begin{align}
v_{R_1}=R_1\cdot i(t)\\ \\
= R_1\left[ \frac{v(t)}{R_1+R_2} \right]\\ \\
=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}\cdot v(t)\tag{2.10}
\end{align}
$$
For $v_{R_2}$ we complete a similar calculation:
$$
\begin{align}
v_{R_2}=\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}\cdot v(t)\tag{2.11}
\end{align}
$$
Having solved all of this the equations we can now see that this fulfils Kirchoffs Voltage Law since we have that
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}\cdot v(t)+\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}\cdot v(t)=v(t)
\end{align}
$$
