Is a tool for automating the management of remote systems and controls their desired state. Ansible is downloaded as part of the *control node*
Within this control node you need a file that describes the *inventory* of the system. This is simply a list of managed nodes that are logically organized.

## Introduction
Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. To do this Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. You simply declare the **desired state** of a local or remote system in your [[#Playbooks|playbook]]. Ansible will try to ensure that the system remains in that state
