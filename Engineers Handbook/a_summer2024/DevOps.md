## The 7Cs of DevOps
1. Continuous Development - Code is written in small continuous parts.
2. Continuous Integration 
	1. Getting the SourceCode from [[Source Code Management]]
	2. Building the code
	3. Code quality review
	4. Storing the build artifacts
3. Continuous Testing - It does what it says on the tin
4. Continuous Deployment - Process of automatically deploying an application into the production environment
5. Continuous Monitoring - Helps the team get notification as or even before something goes wrong
6. Continuous Feedback - The team needs feedback from customers to try to rectify mistakes
7. Continuous Operations - The ideal for any DevOps application is to be able to run continuously

## Lifecycle of DevOps
When we look at the LifeCycle of a DevOps application we can break it down to the following steps based on the 7Cs
**Plan**
**Code**
**Build**
**Test**
**Release**
**Deploy**
**Operate**
**Monitor**

## Good practices
1. Have a centralized unit for DevOps
2. Shift Left with CI/CD
3. Always take a "Security First Approach"
4. Use the right tools
5. Monitor for the right metrics
6. Switch to Microservices
7. Decide which processes need to be automated first
8. Build only once but implement continuous deployment
